                These here are old works of mine, while not front page, they were fruitful to my growth as an artist and
                to my being.

            <h1>"Urban Crab" (2023)</h1>
            <p>
                A fluffy horseshoe crab imitating other animals through idling and touch. This was a collaborative
                experience with my mother alongside starting an small interest in fabric, but mostly about how different
                “materials” lead to different interactions.

            <h1>"Surpasseth" (2019)</h1>
            <p>
                My first introduction to game development with a project in Unreal Engine 4, started my passion for game
                development. It is simply a third-person shooter with platforming elements and a few levels.

            <h1>"Iterative P1" (2022)</h1>
            <p>
                Introduction to prototyping with game development, this project was one of many small prototypes. My
                encouragement to choose this “P1” in particular was because of a peer’s enjoyment of one segment of the
                game.
